## Pattern: solution of a common problems

<h3>3 Benefits</h3>
a. Patterns are proven solutions<br>
b. Patterns can be easily reused<br>
c. Patterns can be expressive<br>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
a. Reusing patterns assists in preventing minor issues that can cause major problems in the application development process.<br>
b. Patterns can provide generalized solutions which are documented in a fashion that doesn't require them to be tied to a specific problem<br>
c. Certain patterns can actually decrease the overall file-size footprint of your code by avoiding repetition.<br>
d. Patterns add to a developers vocabulary, which makes communication faster.<br>
e. Patterns that are frequently used can be improved over time by harnessing the collective experiences other developers using those patterns contribute back to the design pattern community.

<h3>Good Pattern</h3>
a. Solves a particular problem<br>
b. The solution to this problem cannot be obvious<br>
c. The concept described must have been proven:<br>
d. It must describe a relationship:

<h3>Rule of three:</h3>
a. Fitness of purpose - how is the pattern considered successful<br>
b. Usefulness- why is the pattern considered successful?<br>
c. Applicability - is the design worthy of being a pattern because it has wider applicability? If so, this needs to be explained.When reviewing or defining a pattern, it is important to keep the above in mind.<br>

<h3>Categories Of Design Pattern</h3>
Creational Design Patterns :  Constructor, Factory, Abstract, Prototype, Singleton and Builder<br>
Structural Design Patterns : Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Adapter and Proxy<br>
Behavioral Design Patterns : Iterator, Mediator, Observer and Visitor<br>

<h3>Objects</h3>
properties & method : hold complex data structure
