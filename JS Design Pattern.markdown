## Pattern: solution of a common problems

3 Benefits
a. Patterns are proven solutions
b. Patterns can be easily reused
c. Patterns can be expressive

Advantages
a. Reusing patterns assists in preventing minor issues that can cause major problems in the application development process.
b. Reusing patterns assists in preventing minor issues that can cause major problems in the application development process.
c. Certain patterns can actually decrease the overall file-size footprint of your code by avoiding repetition.
d. Patterns add to a developers vocabulary, which makes communication faster.
e. Patterns that are frequently used can be improved over time by harnessing the collective experiences other developers using those patterns contribute back to the design pattern community.

Good Pattern
a. Solves a particular problem
b. The solution to this problem cannot be obvious
c. The concept described must have been proven:
d. It must describe a relationship:

Rule of three:
a. Fitness of purpose - how is the pattern considered successful
b. Usefulness- why is the pattern considered successful?
c. Applicability - is the design worthy of being a pattern because it has wider applicability? If so, this needs to be explained.When reviewing or defining a pattern, it is important to keep the above in mind.
