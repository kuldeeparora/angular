    Q. What is NodeJS <br>
    A. Node.js is an envronment that lets you use javascript outside of its natural environment, which is the browser.
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        What could you build
        <ul>
            <li>Websocket Server - Like a chat server</li>
            <li>Fast File Upload Client</li>
            <li>Ad Server</li>
            <li>Any Real-Time Data Apps</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Nodejs is not
        <ul>
            <li>A Web Framework</li>
            <li>Multi-thread application</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Events in DOM - click, submit, hover
    </li>
    <li>
        EventEmitter - (error, warn or info)events
        <ul>
            <li> it allows you to listen for "events" and assign actions to run when those events occur. If you're
                familiar with front-end JavaScript, you'll know about mouse and keyboard events that occur on certain
                user interactions. These are very similar, except that we can emit events on our own, when we want to,
                and not necessary based on user interaction. The principles EventEmitter is based on have been called
                the publish/subscribe model, because we can subscribe to events and then publish them. There are many
                front-end libraries built with pub/sub support, but Node has it build in.

<ul>
    <li>The Event-Driven Programming
        <ul>
            <li>Event-driven programming is a programming style whereby the flow of execution is determined by
                events. Events are handled by event handlers or event callbacks. An event callback is a function that
                is invoked when something significant happens — such as when the result of a database query is
                available or when the user clicks on a button.</li>
            <li>In event-driven programming you start by defining the code that will be executed when an event
                occurs, then put that code inside a function, and finally pass that function as an argument to be
                called later.</li>
            <li><code>
                query_finished = function(result) {<br>
                do_something_with(result);<br>
                }<br>
                query('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = 1', query_finished);
            </code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Closures
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Example 1</p>
                <code>
                (function() { <br>
                var clickCount = 0; <br>
                $('button#mybutton').click(function() { <br>
                clickCount ++; <br>
                alert('Clicked ' + clickCount + ' times.'); <br>
                }); <br>
                }()); <br>
            </code>

            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Loading Modules
        <ul>
            <li>In Node, modules are referenced either by file path or by name. A module that is referenced by a
                name will eventually map into a file path unless the module is a core module.</li>
            <li>Each module of any type exposes a public API that the programmer can use after the module is
                imported into the current script. To use a module of any type, you have to use the require function
                like this: <br>
                <code>var module = require('module_name');</code> <br>
                This will import a core module or a module installed by NPM. The require function returns
                an object that represents the JavaScript API exposed by the module. Depending on the module, that
                object can be any JavaScript value — a function, an object with some properties that can be
                functions, an array, or any other type of JavaScript object.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Exporting & Loading a Module
        <ul>
            <li>The CommonJS module system is the only way you can share objects or functions among fi les in
                Node. For a sufficiently complex application you should divide some of the classes, objects, or
                functions into reusable well-defined modules. To the module user, a module exposes exactly what
                you specify it to.</li>

    <h3>Important Nodejs</h3>
    1. Node runs all the code in program once & then wait for all call ball function to finish
    2.Module is a variable that represents the module you are currently in.
    Module.exports is the object that the module will export to other scripts that require this module.
    You can export any object.

    <h3>Important Npm</h3>
    1. npm prune will remove unused module
