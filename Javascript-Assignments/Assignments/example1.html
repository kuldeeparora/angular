  A really trivial example of how to create a class hierarchy in JavaScript.

  This is NOT the only way to emulate classical OOP in JavaScript.  It may not
  even be the best way.  But it's a solution and hopefully it'll prove useful
  for beginners.

  Enjoy!

	// Everything in JavaScript is global by default!
	// Here's a really simple way to emulate namespaces in JavaScript.
	var MyNamespace = MyNamespace || {};

	// Define a sample "class" inside our namespace.
	// As of this writing, JavaScript does not support classes
	// (although it will in ECMAScript 6).
	// You emulate classes by creating a function with members, like so:
	MyNamespace.Human = function(firstName, lastName, creditCard)
	{
		// Your "class" is really just one big function.  When you instantiate an
		// object of this class using the *new* keyword, your class definition
		// does double-duty as a constructor and is called like a regular function.
		console.log ("Constructor called!");

		// Defining a property on *this* creates a local property that can vary for
		// each instance.
		this.firstName = firstName;
		this.lastName = lastName;

		// A private varable.  Because it's not set as a property using *this*, it's
		// not accessible outside of this function.
		var _creditCard = creditCard;

		// A public method.  Note it can access the private variables in this class.
		this.getCreditCard = function()
		{
			return _creditCard;
		};

	};

	// Here's another way of defining a public method.  You can pull it outside
	// the scope of the constructor function.  Note that if you do this, you
	// CANNOT access private variables due to scoping.
	MyNamespace.Human.prototype.getFullName = function()
	{
		return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
	};

	// *prototype* is an important concept in JavaScript.
	// If you want to learn more about it works, I have an in-depth example here:
	// https://github.com/stevekwan/experiments/blob/master/javascript/constructor-vs-prototype.html

	// For a public static property, define it as a property of the constructor
	// function itself.  This way it is NOT unique to every given instance.
	MyNamespace.Human.scientificName = "Homo sapiens";

	// Here's how you access the public static property.
	MyNamespace.Human.prototype.getScientificName = function()
	{
		return MyNamespace.Human.scientificName;
	};





	console.log("Now that we've defined a class, let's instantiate an object!");
	var steveKwan = new MyNamespace.Human("Steve", "Kwan", 6543210987654321);

	// This is a public variable, so we can access it.
	console.log(steveKwan.firstName);

	// This is a private variable, so we can't.
	console.log(steveKwan._creditCard);

	// But there's a public method we can use to access that private variable!
	console.log(steveKwan.getCreditCard());

	// Here's another public method I can use as a helper.
	console.log(steveKwan.getFullName());






	console.log(''); // Just here for console formatting




	console.log("Let's create another instance.");
	var johnDoe = new MyNamespace.Human("John", "Doe", 1234567890123456);

	console.log(''); // Just here for console formatting

	console.log("Static variables are the same for all instances...");
	console.log(steveKwan.getScientificName());
	console.log(johnDoe.getScientificName());

	console.log(''); // Just here for console formatting

	console.log("Changing a static variable affects all instances...");
	MyNamespace.Human.scientificName = "Homo sapiens sapiens";
	console.log(steveKwan.getScientificName());
	console.log(johnDoe.getScientificName());





	// That's it for now!

	// At some point I'd like to extend this and give some examples of how
	// inheritance works in JavaScript.

	// Hope this helps!
